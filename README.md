# About

Snowball is an app and web server framework for public health (and other) organizations to easily capture, submit, categorize, review, and distribute user-submitted pictures, audio, and video clips related to emergency events.

The project is named of John Snow, the English physician who systemically traced down the source of a cholera outbreak in 1854, leading to revolutionary changes in public health practices that continue to this day.

Evidence that leads to groundbreaking insight and fundamental change often accumulates over time, like the packing of many small snowflakes to form a powerfall snowball.

Our hope with the snowball application is that it can help organizations collect and make sense of many small bits of evidence that, taken together, help them solve difficult problems.
